                  <p>Hrishikesh or Rishikesh is a city located at the foothills of the Himalayas in the northern part of India also known as ‘The Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas’. Surrounded by three other districts namely Tehri, Pauri and Haridwar, Hrishikesh in its present day has become the commercial and communication hub of the state of Uttarakhand. The city is named after Lord Vishnu who, pleased by Raibhya Rishi’s austerities, appeared as Lord Hrishikesha. At an altitude of approximately 1,360 ft. above sea level, Rishikesh represents the site where Lord Vishnu vanquished the demon Madhu.</p>

              <h3>Mission</h3>
              <p>Our spiritual life begins when one inquires about the nature of the absolute truth. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What should I do? Where am I going? In our journey of self realization, to empower each and everyone to return to their eternal relationship with the Lord, in this age of Kalyuga, is one of our missions. Lord Krishna has himself stated in the Bhagwad Gita:</p>
              <p class="quote-sm text-success">
              “O Arjuna, listen to how you shall know Me fully without any doubt, with your mind absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, and trying to reach Me.” (7.01)
              </p>
              <p>Our Mission</p>
              <p class="lead">To impart and deliver spiritual knowledge to anyone desirous of approaching Krishna conscious in accordance with the ancient scriptures and traditions of Vedic India.</p>
              <p class="lead">To teach and educate fundamental procedures and regulations about the correct way to approach the Lord to make strong progress in spiritual life through Harinam Sankirtan, Bhagavad Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, Vaishnava culture and philosophy, Bhakti Yoga , etc.</p>
              <p class="lead">To promote the chanting of the holy names of the Lord as revealed by Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.</p>
              <p class="lead">To support and encourage upliftment of the society at large.</p>
              <hr class="line"/>
              <h3>Philosophy</h3>
              <p class="text-success lead">Bhakti Yoga</p>
              <p>In the current Age of Kali we live in, to be free of any form of anxiety and attain bliss, acquiring and developing sincere efforts towards the true spiritual science is the only way to salvation. Understanding we are eternal spirit souls, parts and parcel of the Lord, accepting the process of transmigration of the soul, believing Lord Krishna as the eternal, all-knowing, omnipresent, all-powerful, and all-attractive, consciously studying the absolute truth as contained in the Vedas from a genuine spiritual master, performing all actions as offerings to the Lord and to chant the holy names of the Lord with love and devotion is prescribed.</p>
              <p>In our material existence, our love and devotion towards God, or simply put, our Bhakti is covered by gross material consciousness and is misdirected away from Krishna. Above all, Bhakti Yoga is the only way to develop our dedication, our service and our love for the supreme being, Krishna.</p>
              <p class="text-success lead">Chanting the Holy Names of the Lord</p>
              <p>The names of God and God Himself are identical. The practical system for everyone is the chanting of the name of Godhead. In Bhakti yoga, chanting the Hare Krishna Mahamantra on japa beads is the most potent and important method of purification. This is done through quiet individual japa or kirtan. Chanting cleanses the heart, calms the mind, and inspires a life of purpose and meaning. It is universal &amp; not a sectarian mantra for particular type of people.</p>
              <p class="text-success lead">How to chant</p>
              <p>As you chant, pronounce the names clearly and distinctly, addressing Krishna in a prayerful mood and listen to your own self. Concentrate on the Holy names of the Lord and if, or when your mind wanders, bring it back and restart. Chanting is a prayer to Krishna.</p>
              <p>The Hare Krishna Maha Mantra means “O energy of the Lord [Hare], O all-attractive Lord [Krishna], O Supreme Enjoyer [Rama], please engage me in Your service.” The more attentively and sincerely you chant, the more spiritual progress you will make.</p>

The Deities of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Gaur Nitai, Radha Govindji and Lord Jagannath, Balram and Subhadra preside in the inner sanctum overlooking the congregational hall. The main dome of the temple extends over 100 feet from the base.

              <p>At Madhuban Ashram, we have recently made a provision for a “Goshala” or protective shelters for cows and adopted 4 cows and a baby bull, Nandu for the pleasure of Sri Sri Radha Govindji.

The Goshala is a facility in the temple complex itself which is managed by a team of trained dairy men who take care of their needs.</p>

                  <p>The Jagannath Rath Yatra or the Festival of Chariots of Lord Jagannath originated five thousand years ago in India on the east coast state of Orissa in a city known as Jagannatha Puri. Every year, the presiding deities of the main temple, Sri Mandira, Lord Jagannatha, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra, with the celestial wheel Sudarshana are taken out from the temple precincts in an elaborate ritual procession to their respective chariots. The huge, colourfully decorated chariots, are drawn by hundreds and thousands of devotees on the bada danda, to the Gundicha temple. After a stay for seven days, the deities return to their abode in Sri Mandira.</p>
                  <p>Today, this festival is celebrated not only all over India but also all over the world. It is an annual celebration in which Lord Jagannatha, the Lord of the Universe, along with his brother Balarama and sister Subhadra come out of their temple precincts to give Darshan to all devotees irrespective of any sect or community.</p>
                  <p>The Rath Yatra is suffused with devotional sentiments for the Lord and devotees  earnestly pray to the Lord to steer the chariots of their mundane lives through the vicissitudes of Samsara. It is said that those who participate in the Lord Jagannath Rath Yatra earn passage to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>A glimpse of Lord Jagannatha on the chariot is considered to be very auspicious and saints, poets and scriptures have repeatedly glorified the sanctity of this special festival.</p>
                  <p>The sanctity of the festival is so great that, it is believed, that even a touch of the chariot or even the ropes with which the chariots are pulled is considered enough to confer the results of several pious deeds or penance for ages.</p>
